Manual Docker Workflow (Local or on EC2)
Use these step-by-step Docker commands:

🔁 Step 1: Clone your project from GitHub
cd /opt/docker   # or wherever you want
rm -rf news
git clone https://github.com/AyushShukla66/project_aws.git news
cd news


🔑 Step 2: Log in to Docker Hub
docker login -u ayushditiss -p Ayushshukla@66


🏗️ Step 3: Build Docker image
docker build -t ayushditiss/news_project:latest .

✅ This command looks for the Dockerfile inside /opt/docker/news and builds the image.

🏷️ Step 4: Tag the image (optional but recommended)
docker tag ayushditiss/news_project:latest ayushditiss/news_project:latest


📤 Step 5: Push image to Docker Hub
docker push ayushditiss/news_project:latest


✅ Final Check (Optional)
docker images          # check if image is built
docker ps -a           # check running/stopped containers


🚀 Deploy to Kubernetes After Push
Once your image is pushed, you can now use your Ansible playbook (kubernatics-deploy.yml) to apply deployment:
ansible-playbook kubernatics-deploy.yml


If you want help rewriting the Dockerfile, cleaning images, or automating cleanup—just ask.
